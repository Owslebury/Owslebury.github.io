# LogMyStation

Long time no see! I would like to share a project I've been working on recently. I have been creating an web app called LogMyStation. This app will allow you to see a map of all the train stations in the UK and allow users to log all the ones they've been to. I have also included useful information about each station, such as accessibility information and live departures. You can also see the adjacent stations for each station, allowing you to easily navigate railways.

You can see accessibility and facility information at a glance with useful symbology. You also have expandable data about escalators and departures.

These allow you to easily navigate railway lines, by displaying physically adjacent stations.

## User Authentication

Logging is a protected route. The database allows users to store their logs in a Firebase database.

You can see all of the places you've been in chronological order on your profile (by pressing the 3 bars in the corner).
