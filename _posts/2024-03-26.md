# My First Post
Welcome to my first post on this blog. On here I intend to show what I've been working on.
I am starting a project of creating an animation software. Today I worked on creating the GUI, which involved seperating FXML files and stub classes. Tomorrow I aim to complete the means of communication between controllers.
